She turns to face you, her eyes aflame with inspiration. “I had been studying their physiology, attempting to discern how they could exist the way they do, without shape, without matter, without state. But I was going about it all wrong. One cannot study the biology of something inorganic. See, it is not a creature, not truly. It is more akin to…” she hesitates, attempting to find the right words. “It is an alternate dimension. Another reality, superimposed on ours. A sentient microcosm of all that is. Not composed of organic life, but a mockery of it.”</p><p>This newfound understanding of the phantasms you have encountered and the mirages you have seen put everything into context.

The Elder Thing’s facility held five pylons that used its essence to power their civilization, but after this long, I cannot imagine they still function. But perhaps…” she trails off, formulating a plan. Finally, her eyes widen with realization. “I know what must be done. I know how to stop it. You must find these pylons and destroy them—doing so will bring the entire compound down. In the meantime…” she hefts her backpack off of her shoulder, dropping it to the ground. “I…I must be off now.
