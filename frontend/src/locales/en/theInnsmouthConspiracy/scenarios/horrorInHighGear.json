   "body": "<p>Trees whizz by as you rumble along the old dirt road just outside of Innsmouth. The sun has set over the western horizon, leaving only the full moon to bathe the dusty roads in its brilliant, eerie glow. “Here,” Agent Harper shouts from the passenger seat over the rumbling of the automobile engine. She points to a spot on the map she has spread across her lap, tapping it repeatedly. “Falcon Point Lighthouse. That’s where Oceiros should be.” A shudder courses up your spine. If your memories are to be believed, Oceiros is the man who left you to die in those tidal tunnels. You ask Harper how far Falcon Point is from Innsmouth, hoping to arrive before the Order realizes you’ve escaped. She sighs. “It’s not that far, but these roads are meandering. They could be difficult to navigate. One wrong turn and—” both you and Harper see the lights in your rearview mirror at the same time. Headlights. And they’re growing larger and brighter by the second. Harper curses under her breath. “I don’t suppose those are friends of yours?” You shake your head and tighten your grip on the wheel. It seems the Order has already caught wind of your flight from Innsmouth. You tell Agent Harper to hold on and slam your foot on the accelerator.</p>"
